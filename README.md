# Wikidata interactions for the LOTUS Initiative

This project is divided in multiple parts:

- [uploadLotus](uploadLotus/README.md) : Used to upload LOTUS data to Wikidata
- [downloadLotus](downloadLotus/README.md) : Used to download LOTUS data from Wikidata
  It is also used by uploadLotus to check what already exists on Wikidata
- WDKt : A library to interact with Wikidata in Kotlin (used by the uploader)
